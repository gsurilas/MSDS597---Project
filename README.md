# MSDS597---Project

This project uses Gallup 2016/2017 Happiness Poll data, scraped biographies from Wikipedia and scraped books from the R-Gutenberg package to examine happiness trends around the world and to specifically look at 5 countries: Greece, France, UK, US and Russia. We then look into the prominent authors from these countries and examine the relationship between their country of origin and their life and works and whether the happiness of a country correlates with the happiness of its authors.

The final table produced after joining the Wikipedia scraped data and the book data from R-Gutenberg package is saved in the excel sheet called tidydata. In the R Markdown file this table is called authors_and_bios.
