# MSDS597---Project

The code was broken into several scripts. The Author Biographies creates the tables related to the mean biography score of the authors' wikipedia pages. The Authors Books creates the tables related to the AFINN sentiment analysis related to the books of each author. The Advanced Sentiment Analysis creates the table related to the NRC sentiment analysis of the books by each author. The Happiness Plots scripts deals with the 2016/2017 Gallup Happiness data and creates the plots related to the overall happiness data. Lastly, the Plots and Tables script creates the tables and plots related to the literary analysis of the five specified country.

All 4 of these scripts are contained in the R Markdown file in order to produce the full report, so all their contents can be viewed at once in the R Markdown.

The final table produced after joining the Wikipedia scraped data and the book data from R-Gutenberg package is saved in the excel sheet called tidydata. In the R Markdown file this table is called authors_and_bios.

In order to run the R Markdown on your machine you need to download the Gallup 2016/2017 data onto your computer. Other than this the R Markdown file should run on any machine.
